# GoogleDomainsDdnsService
C# Windows Service (**.NET Framework 4.6**) to update your Google Domains Dynamic DNS subdomains for your Google hosted domains

Build it yourself or grab the binaries

## What is this for?

If you want to host a service (web site, etc) on your local connection, but your ISP issues you a dynamic IP address, you'll need
a way to update your DNS entry for the service so that the outside world knows that XYZ.blah.com has a new IP address. 

That's where this comes in, but only for domains hosted by Google.

If you're using Google Domains as your domain registrar, you can specify a Dynamic DNS subdomain. Log in to <https://domains.google.com/>
and click on DNS for your domain. There will be a **Synthetic records** section. Change the dropdown to **Dynamic DNS** and enter a 
subdomain. [ XYZ ] .blah.com. Click Add.

You now have a Dynamic DNS subdomain. Expand the Dynamic DNS section for your created subdomain and click **View Credentials**. 
You'll need these to configure GoogleDomainsDdnsSvc.

## Configuration File Overview
The GoogleDomainsDdnsSvc.exe.config defines the hosts and how often to update their Dynamic DNS entries. 
The default interval is every 24 hours an update will occur. There are five fields that make up a &lt;domains&gt; collection entry.

* hostname: The host entry (xyz.blah.com) you wish to update
* username: The generated username for the Dynamic DNS host entry from **Dynamic DNS** / (your subdomain) / **View Credentials** on the Google Domains DNS manager
* password: The generated password for the Dynamic DNS host entry from **Dynamic DNS** / (your subdomain) / **View Credentials** on the Google Domains DNS manager
* longDelay: Time in milliseconds between each Dynamic DNS update (Optional, default 86400000 or 24 hours)
* shortDelay: Time in milliseconds between each Dynamic DNS update IF Google responds with a 911 or other error (Optional, default 600000 or 10 minutes)

```
    <googleDomains>
        <domains>
            <clear />
            <add hostname="xyz.blah.com" username="ABC123" password="ABC123" />
        </domains>
    </googleDomains>
```

## How to Use (binaries)

* Download/clone the contents of the build folder to a local folder (e.g. C:\ProgramFiles\GoogleDomainsDdnsSvc\)
